# second-hand-shop-web
This project consists in creating the web of a second-hand shop called B3 using HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL.
I used the programme xampp and then started the MySQL module. 
Before using the web, we need to paste the files contained in the B3_web folder (unzip the B3_web rar file) inside the htdocs folder created after the installation of xampp.
Firstly, we need to create the database and the users and product tables with phpMyAdmin.
To do this, we paste the next URL in our browser:
http://localhost/basedatos.php to create the database.
http://localhost/tablausuarios.php to create the users table.
http://localhost/tablaproductos.php to create the products table.
After creating the three things in phpMyAdmin we just need to charge the first page to browse through the web.
To do this, we paste the next URL in our browser:
http://localhost/index.php
